This program demonstrates a small algorithm for drawing rhombuses of various sizes using ASCII graphics. The program provides functions for drawing both outlines and filled rhombuses of a specified size.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a compatible environment.
2. Choose whether you want to draw an outline or a filled rhombus.
3. Input the desired size for the rhombus.
4. Witness the ASCII art come to life, forming beautiful rhombus patterns.

## Features

- Create ASCII art rhombuses with ease.
- Draw both outline and filled versions of rhombus patterns.
- Explore different sizes to see how patterns evolve.

## Instructions

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the program's directory.
3. Run the program using `python rhombus_drawer.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose the type and size of the rhombus.
